Link to the RPub Document: https://rpubs.com/shubhsharma/mba6693_assignment2

In this assignment, we are going to find the best classification model (among Multinomial Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis and k-Nearest Neighbors) that can fit the Iris data set. We will also look at the relationship between error rates and model complexity. We will also look at the relationship between several predictors and the response variable and find out which predictor(s) best describe the response variable.
